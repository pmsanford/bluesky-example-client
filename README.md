bluesky-example-client
======================

An example of a client written with [atrium](https://github.com/sugyan/atrium) for bluesky, mostly as an exercise to learn how to log in, refresh tokens, and interact with the API.

Just [create an app password](https://bsky.app/settings/app-passwords) and set `BSKY_USERNAME` and `BSKY_APP_PASS` to your bluesky username and app password, then run the app. You can then paste post URLs and have them retrieved and summarized in your console:
